# Testing Docs

This folder tracks feature-specific test design documents.

Guidelines:
- Create one document per major feature area.
- Keep each doc focused on test strategy, coverage, execution commands, pass/fail criteria, and known gaps.
- Update docs as implementation changes, thresholds change, or new regressions are found.

Current documents:
- `aa-testing.md` - anti-aliasing test design and execution workflow.
